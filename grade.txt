This is really cool work!

I see that you did not put your UI in here.  I actually think that's an important part of your project, so you should keep them together.  Also-- I was looking forward to trying out your UI myself.  You should put it all together in one project, particularly since you presented the UI as an essential part of the language (and I tend to agree!).
