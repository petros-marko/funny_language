# Instructions for starting up the interface

Clone the repository and cd into the directory. Navigate to lang/funny_visual_interface and cd into the version that works for your operating system (linux or windows for the time being). Don't move anything, as the interface will not work if placed in a different directory. Open a terminal in that directory and run the file named funny_visual_interface.

# Instructions for using the interface

The interface is separated into two parts: the _Toolbox_ and the _Workshop_. In the toolbox you can find the available functions in a list. You can scroll through it to find what you are looking for. Clicking on any of those functions will make a copy of it in the _Workshop_, allowing it to be used for making other functions. For reasons that will be explained, you should not insert a new function without moving the old one out of the way first (by dragging it). To delete a function that has been inserted into the _Workshop_ you can double click it.

The _Workshop_ is where programming happens. There is a scrollable space in which functions are put to be composed into more complex functions. You can drag functions around with the mouse. However, because this is a prototype for the interface, dragging the mouse close to two functions will cause them both to jump at the cursor and overlap, making it impossible to take them apart or use them in any meaningful way, or delete. That is why handling this early version of the interface needs to be done carefully and can become frustrating. Values can be inserted into the _Workshop_ by clicking the square on the upper right corner. You will be prompted to type in the value that you want to insert. Acceptable values are integers, the words True, False and Nil. Any other string of characters will be considered a function argument and it will behave differently (as will be explained soon). Moving values around is done by the mouse and is subject to the same limitations as moving functions around. Passing values to functions is easy. Click the value and then click the function. This applies to connecting functions to functions as well. You cannot pass arguments to values. All programs should be formatted such that they end in a single function whose output is the output is the output of the whole contraption. You can run a program of that form only if it has no arguments (which, as mentioned above is any input other than a number, True, False and Nil), by hitting the rightmost button on the upper left. If there are arguments in your workshop, the function will not run and it will probably cause an error. If there are arguments in the workshop, you can use the leftmost button to save it as a new function, and you will be prompted for a name (which can only be made up of letters). After saving a function it will appear in the _Toolbox_ and it can be used like any other function.

In the program generated, arguments are passed to functions in the order in which they were added in the interface. So, for example, if I wanted to make a function ```plusOne```, this is the process that I would need to follow. Add the function ```plus``` from the _Toolbox_ and move it to a comfortable position in my workshop. Add the value ```1``` using the button on the upper right corner, move it to a comfortable position and then successively click on the ```1``` and the ```plus``` function. This will add ```1``` as the first argument passed to the function. Then I would add the value ```n``` from using the button, move it to a comfortable position and successively click on ```n``` and the function. Note that the order of the arguments is reflected on the positions in which the lines from the arguments to the function connect: the line connecting farther to the left corresponds to the first argument, the next one to the second etc. Now I can hit the save button and give the name ```plusOne```. Now ```plusOne``` appears in the _Toolbox_ to be used as any other function. As a test, I can now pull it into the _Workshop_, give it the value ```1``` as an argument and hit the run button. The number 2 should appear in the terminal (eventually it will appear in the interface).
